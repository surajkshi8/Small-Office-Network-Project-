# Small-Office-Network-Project-
This project is a small office network made in Cisco Packet Tracer. It shows how to connect PCs, switches and a router so the devices can talk to each other. It includes basic IP setup, simple routing and a layout that anyone can follow. It’s meant for learning and for anyone who wants a clean example of a small office network.
